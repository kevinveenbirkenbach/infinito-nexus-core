# Validate a run's selection inputs against the branch it would deploy from,

# Inputs via env:
#   INPUT_WHITELIST   whitelist value of the run ('' = nothing to check)
#   INPUT_PRIORITY    priority line of the run ('' = nothing to check)
#   INPUT_MODE        deploy modes the run draws from
#   INPUT_NETWORK     network axis of the run
#   INPUT_DISTROS     distro pool of the run ('' = every declared distro)
#   INPUT_FILESYSTEM  filesystem pool of the run ('' = every declared kind)
#   INPUT_LIFECYCLES  lifecycle envelope of the run
#
# Exits non-zero when a token names a row this branch does not have or pins an
# axis the row cannot take; cli.meta.ci.validate reports every offender at once,
# so a stale list is fixed in one pass rather than one CI round per entry.
