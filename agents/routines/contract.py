"""The routine contract: a routine declares ordered steps and renders a
Mermaid flowchart from them; ``build`` compiles the steps into a LangGraph
graph. LangGraph is imported lazily inside ``build`` so ``show`` needs only
this module, never the graph engine.

A step's ``kind`` is one of:

- ``deterministic``: a node that calls repository logic in ``cli/`` or
  ``utils/`` through a make target or ``python -m``; it runs no model and
  reads no untrusted input into a tool.
- ``model``: the only kind that calls the gateway; it reads untrusted input
  and holds no tools.
- ``ask``: a node that pauses for an owner approval through the orchestrator.
- ``terminal``: an end state (a report, a pull request, a skip).
