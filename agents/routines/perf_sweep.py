"""Tuner routine: find a real, measured performance win and ship it without
lowering coverage, correctness or a budget. Deterministic steps call
``python -m cli.tune.logscan`` and the gate; one model step picks the biggest
win; the benchmark step takes a before and after from the same source and the
same image and load state."""
