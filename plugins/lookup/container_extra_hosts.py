"""Lookup ``container_extra_hosts``: the single emitter of ``extra_hosts:``.

Compose rejects a mapping that carries the key twice, so nothing else in the
repo may write ``extra_hosts:`` by hand. Everything a service needs pinned goes
through here, from two sources that are both optional:

1. The SSO back-channel pin, added automatically. On an onion deployment the
   OIDC endpoints handed to an application are public ``.onion`` authorities.
   That is right for the browser, which reaches them through Tor, but
   unroutable for the application's own server-side calls (code-to-token
   exchange, JWKS, userinfo): a container resolves ``.onion`` through Tor's
   resolver, not through DNS. Pinning the provider to a reachable address sends
   those calls over the local network to the proxy that already serves the
   vhost. Skipped unless the application has SSO enabled and the provider vhost
   is an ``.onion`` name, so it is a no-op on clearnet.
2. ``host_alias=true``, which pins ``host.docker.internal`` at whatever reaches
   the host in the effective mode. A container that must talk to a service the
   host publishes -- msmtp relaying through the swarm ingress on :587, for
   instance -- needs the alias, and it must not hardcode ``host-gateway``
   because that breaks under swarm for the reason below.
3. ``extra_hosts=``, whatever the call site needs on top: a peer's overlay VIP,
   or a partner service reachable only on the host.

Entries are ``"name:address"`` strings and are deduplicated in first-seen
order. With nothing to emit the lookup returns an empty string.

``entries_only=true`` returns those strings as a list instead of the rendered
block, for a container that is not described by a compose file at all:
``web-app-discourse`` is built by discourse_docker's ``launcher``, whose only
argument surface is ``docker_args:`` in its ``app.yml``, so it needs
``--add-host=<entry>`` lines.

The automatic pin follows the effective deploy mode, and in swarm it must NOT be
``host-gateway``: that alias resolves per node, while openresty publishes :80
with ``mode: host`` under ``node.role == manager``, so every replica on a worker
dialled its own gateway and the token exchange died with 'Connection refused'
(7b1839681, measured on penpot in run 31340965955). Swarm therefore gets the
stack host's routable address -- the destination svc-net-tor already sends all
hidden-service traffic to. ``ansible_facts`` carries it because the compose file
is rendered once with the manager as inventory host and swarm applies the same
``extra_hosts`` to every task.

The mode is read as ``compose_mode_force or DEPLOYMENT_MODE`` rather than the
bare cluster mode, because ``container_networks`` resolves attachments through
that same effective mode: a role with an override must not lose its pin and its
overlay at once.

Caller-supplied entries are passed through untouched, so a call site that needs
a different address per mode must still decide that itself.

Usage in any service template:

    {{ lookup('container_extra_hosts') | indent(4) }}
    {{ lookup('container_extra_hosts',
              extra_hosts=['host.docker.internal:host-gateway']) | indent(4) }}
    {{ lookup('container_extra_hosts', application_id='web-app-nextcloud') | indent(4) }}

Usage from a non-compose call site:

    {% for entry in lookup('container_extra_hosts',
                           entries_only=True, wantlist=True) %}
      - --add-host={{ entry }}
    {% endfor %}
