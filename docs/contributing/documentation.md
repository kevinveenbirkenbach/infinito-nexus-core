# Documentation 📝

All project documentation MUST be reachable at [docs.infinito.nexus](https://docs.infinito.nexus/).

## Comments 💬

- You SHOULD write code so it is logical and self-explanatory and usually does not need comments.
- You MUST add code comments only when an exception, edge case, or surprising decision would otherwise confuse readers.
- You MUST use comments to explain why something is unusual, not to restate what obvious code already does.
- When keeping an intentionally retained outdated version pin, you MUST document the exception at the pin site with a local `TODO` comment in the file's normal comment style (`#todo`, `# TODO`, or similar) and explain why it remains pinned so the root cause stays visible until it can be fixed.

## Requirement Keywords (RFC 2119) 📋

You MUST use [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) keywords in all documentation to express requirement levels unambiguously:

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MUST` / `REQUIRED` / `SHALL` | Absolute requirement. No deviation allowed. |
| `MUST NOT` / `SHALL NOT` | Absolute prohibition. Never do this. |
| `SHOULD` / `RECOMMENDED` | Strongly recommended. Deviation requires justification. |
| `SHOULD NOT` / `NOT RECOMMENDED` | Strongly discouraged. Allowed only with justification. |
| `MAY` / `OPTIONAL` | Permitted but not required. |

## Links 🔗

- You MUST NOT use the full URL as link text. Use the domain name, `here`, or the filename instead. Never use the full path.
- After `See`, you MUST use the domain name as link text, not `here`. `here` is only acceptable when the surrounding sentence reads naturally with it (e.g. "More information [here](...)").
- For communication links such as Matrix, email, or phone, you MUST show only the value itself as link text, without any protocol prefix or URL wrapper.

| Type | MUST NOT | MUST |
|---|---|---|
| Web link | `https://docs.infinito.example/` | `docs.infinito.example`, `here`, a descriptive label, or `setup.md` |
| File link | `docs/contributing/workflow.md` | `workflow.md` or `Contribution Flow` |
| Email | `mailto:hello@infinito.nexus` | `hello@infinito.nexus` |
| Matrix | `[#room:infinito.nexus](https://some-url.example/)` | `@user:infinito.nexus` |
| Phone | `tel:+491234567890` | `+49 123 456 7890` |

## Semantics and Writing ✍️

- You MUST keep code and comments in English.
- You MUST fix nearby wording and semantic issues when you touch a file, and correct obvious nearby issues proactively in the same pass.
- You SHOULD use emojis when they make the text more visually appealing, improve the mood, and increase readability.
- You MUST NOT use em dashes (—) as thought breaks or clause separators. You SHOULD prefer complete sentences. Hyphens (-) MAY be used for compound words and list items.

## Headlines 🏷️

- You SHOULD place emojis after the headline text to visually highlight headings and improve scannability.
- You MUST NOT place emojis before the headline text, as this interferes with heading hierarchy rendering in some tools.
- You MUST NOT add emojis to headlines in `docs/agents/` files, as these are machine-readable instruction files where emojis interfere with parsing.

## Documentation Structure 🗂️

### Role README 📄

See [readme_md.md](artefact/files/role/readme_md.md) for the requirement, required structure, section order, and formatting rules for role `README.md` files.

### Docs README 📄

See [Docs README](artefact/files/docs/readme_md.md) for the purpose, scope, and navigation rules for `README.md` files stored inside `docs/` directories.

### Markdown 📋
- You SHOULD prefer `README.md` for directory-level documentation when a human-facing entry point already exists.
- You MUST keep core information inside the repository, either in code or in `.md` files.
- You MUST use `.md` files for commands, workflows, setup, and contributor guidance.
- You MUST NOT use `.md` files to describe implementation logic that is already visible in the code.

### Sphinx 📚

- The root `index.rst` uses a `:glob:` toctree (`docs/**`) to automatically include every documentation page.
- Sphinx indexing SHOULD happen automatically through that root `:glob:` toctree.
- You SHOULD avoid creating or maintaining manual per-directory indexes when automatic indexing already covers the same pages.
  An additional `index.rst` inside a `docs/` subdirectory is NOT RECOMMENDED because the root index already covers those pages automatically, but it MAY be added when a focused local entry point materially improves navigation.
  If such a local `index.rst` is added, it SHOULD stay minimal and MUST NOT duplicate a manually curated page inventory that the automatic index already provides.
- You MUST keep cross-links between `.md` files up to date so readers can navigate between related pages.
