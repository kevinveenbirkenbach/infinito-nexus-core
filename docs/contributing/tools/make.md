# Makefile Commands 🛠️

Use these commands from the repository root. This is the SPOT for `make` targets in Infinito Nexus.
Use the dedicated script READMEs for the underlying shell helpers, and use the development/testing guides for deeper workflow details.

For rules on how to write and structure the `Makefile` itself, see [makefile.md](../artefact/files/makefile.md).

## Image Builds 🏗️

| Category | Command | What it does | When to use it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build | `make build` | Builds the local image for the active `INFINITO_DISTRO`. | Use this after Dockerfile changes or whenever you want a fresh local image. |
| Build if missing | `make build-missing` | Builds the image only when it is not already present locally. | Use this for a quick local check when you do not want to rebuild unnecessarily. |
| No-cache build | `make build-no-cache` | Rebuilds the image without Docker cache. | Use this when cache reuse might hide a change or when you are debugging the build. |
| No-cache all distros | `make build-no-cache-all` | Rebuilds the no-cache image for every distro in `DISTROS`. | Use this for release-level validation or when you need to verify all distro variants. |
| Build dependency image | `make build-dependency` | Pulls the `pkgmgr` base image used by the build. | Use this when you want to refresh the base image or debug build inputs. |
| Cleanup CI images | `make build-cleanup` | Removes Docker images created for CI-style build workflows. | Use this when local disk usage grows or old CI images accumulate. |
| Regenerate Docker ignore | `make dockerignore` | Regenerates `.dockerignore` from `.gitignore`. | Use this when the Docker ignore file needs to be refreshed. |

## Install 📦

| Category | Command | What it does | When to use it |
|---|---|---|---|
| System Python prerequisites | `make install-system-python` | Installs the system Python prerequisites. | Use this when the host is missing the Python base packages. |
| Virtual environment | `make install-venv` | Creates the virtual environment. | Use this when you need the repository Python environment. |
| Python tooling | `make install-python` | Installs the Python tooling. | Use this when you need the Python toolchain after creating the virtual environment. |
| Python dev tooling | `make install-python-dev` | Installs Python tooling including lint and dev dependencies, and registers the pre-commit hooks. | Use this when setting up a local development environment. Called automatically by `make environment-bootstrap`. |
| Ansible dependencies | `make install-ansible` | Installs the Ansible dependencies. | Use this when you changed Ansible-related code or need the Ansible collections. |
| Lint dependencies | `make install-lint` | Installs lint-related tooling. | Use this when you only need the lint stack. |
| Install agent skills | `make install-skills` | Restores all agent skills from `skills-lock.json` via `scripts/install/skills/install.sh`. Works universally for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, and more. Skipped gracefully when `npx` is absent. | Use this when setting up a local AI coding agent environment. Not part of `make environment-bootstrap`. Intended for IDE-specific setup. |
| Update agent skills | `make update-skills` | Updates all agent skills to their latest versions by re-running `skills add` for each source in `skills-lock.json` via `scripts/install/skills/update.sh`. Requires `npx` and `jq`. | Use this to pull the latest skill versions and refresh `skills-lock.json`. |
| Agent sandbox dependencies | `make agent-install` | Installs the OS-level dependencies (`bubblewrap`, `socat`) that the Claude Code sandbox backend requires, via `scripts/install/sandbox.sh`. Supports Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS/RHEL/Rocky/Alma, and Arch. | Use this on a fresh host before running Claude Code so the sandbox backend is present. Needs root or `sudo`. |
| Full install | `make install` | Installs the repository tooling needed for development and tests. | Use this on a fresh machine or before validation. |

## Environment Setup 🖥️

| Category | Command | What it does | When to use it |

| Trust local CA | `make trust-ca` | Trusts the local CA on Linux and WSL2. | Use this after the CA or host entries change. |
| Disable IPv6 | `make disable-ipv6` | Disables IPv6 for local development, restarts `docker.service`, and then calls `make refresh` so a running Infinito dev stack is recreated when one is active. | Use this when a workflow needs IPv6 off. |
| Restore IPv6 | `make restore-ipv6` | Restores the previous IPv6 settings, restarts `docker.service`, and then calls `make refresh` so a running Infinito dev stack is recreated when one is active. | Use this after a temporary IPv6 change. |

## Git 🔐

Remote setup and signed pushes are handled by [git-maintainer-tools](https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/git-maintainer-tools), installed through `make install-python-dev` (see [remotes.md](../artefact/git/remotes.md)). The tool's `git-setup-remotes` and `git-sign-push` CLIs MUST be invoked directly; there are no `make` wrappers in this repo. Direct `git push` is denied in [settings.json](../../../.claude/settings.json), and agents MUST instruct the operator to run `git-sign-push` outside the Claude sandbox.

## Notes 📝

- The commands use the current `INFINITO_DISTRO` setting from the environment where relevant.
- For app-level local deploy flows and end-to-end checks, see [Development](../actions/testing.md).
- For validation strategy and Playwright guidance, see [Testing and Validation](../actions/testing.md).
