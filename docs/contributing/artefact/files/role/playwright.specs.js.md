# `playwright.spec.js` 🎭

This page is the primary SPOT for what a role-local `files/playwright.spec.js` MUST contain in a `web-*` role's Playwright suite. All scenario, selector, and final-state rules live here.
For framework, runner wiring, and the central image pin, see [Playwright Tests](../../../actions/testing/playwright.md).
For the agent-specific authoring procedure (how to generate and review the file automatically), see [Agent `playwright.spec.js`](../../../../agents/files/role/playwright.spec.js.md).
For the matching rendered environment contract, see [Agent `playwright.env.j2`](../../../../agents/files/role/playwright.env.j2.md).

## File Placement 📁

- You MUST place the spec at `roles/<role>/files/playwright.spec.js`.
- The central-vs-per-role rule for `package.json` and `playwright.config.js` is owned by the framework SPOT. See [Playwright Tests: Role-Local Files](../../../actions/testing/playwright.md#role-local-files-).

## Entry Point 🚪

- The flow MUST start at `APP_BASE_URL`.
- When the role exposes the dashboard entry (`compose.services.dashboard.enabled` is set), the first navigation MUST go through the dashboard, not straight into the app.

## Scenarios 🎬

- Every spec MUST verify login AND logout end to end. No scenario may finish while the session is still authenticated.
- Every scenario MUST reflect the role's actual post-login behavior, not only that a URL loaded. Assert on a user-visible state that confirms the session is genuinely active (an authenticated-only element, a user menu, or an accessible admin area) instead of stopping at URL assertions or static text checks.
- Every persona the role supports MUST have its own scenario. For roles covering both `biber` and `administrator`, keep one scenario per persona. Do not overload a single test with two identities.
- When the role enables OIDC or LDAP, at least one scenario MUST exercise the integrated login path so the auth-flow wiring is covered end to end (not only the local-form login).
- A scenario MUST be added or updated whenever role-local `style.css` or `javascript.js` changes user-visible behavior, asserting on the visible effect.
- When the application supports peer-to-peer messaging, the spec MUST cover a bi-directional exchange between `biber` and `administrator`: `biber` sends a direct message to `administrator` AND `administrator` sends one back, each delivery asserted in the recipient's inbox from an isolated browser context.
- Existing scenarios MUST NOT be deleted when optimizing a spec. Rewrite them to satisfy the MUSTs above or strengthen their assertions, but do not shrink coverage by removing a scenario — deletions are only acceptable when the underlying behavior has been removed from the role itself.

## Selectors and Waits ⏳

- Selectors MUST prefer accessible roles, form-scoped buttons, and other stable hooks over brittle DOM lookups or generic labels that can match unrelated UI (e.g. topbar search vs. login submit).
- Waits MUST target meaningful page state (visible elements, URL changes, attached locators). Fixed sleeps MUST NOT be used where an explicit wait is available.
- When a flow runs inside an iframe and login or OIDC clicks can reload it, the spec MUST treat the reload as a navigation event: await the next visible state or the new iframe URL, then reacquire the frame and rebuild locators before the next interaction. A stale iframe handle MUST NOT be reused across redirects, and the spec MUST NOT "click and observe the failure" against a frame it already knows will have been replaced.

## Environment Contract 🔌

- Every environment variable the spec reads MUST be exposed in the role's `templates/playwright.env.j2`. Names MUST match exactly on both sides.
- URLs, domains, and credentials MUST NOT be hardcoded in the spec. They MUST come from the rendered `.env`.

## Final State ✅

- Every scenario MUST end with the browser in a clearly logged-out state.
- The browser console MUST be clean of errors when the flow depends on injected JavaScript.
