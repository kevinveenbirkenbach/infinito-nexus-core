"""Data types for the development inventory matrix.

`DevInventorySpec` is the value type `build_dev_inventory` consumes —
it carries everything `infinito administration inventory provision`
needs to materialise one development inventory folder. `PlanEntry` is
the per-round tuple `plan_dev_inventory_matrix` emits and the deploy
wrapper iterates.

    """Everything `infinito administration inventory provision` needs to
    materialise one development inventory folder.

    `extra_vars` wins over the implicit `STORAGE_CONSTRAINED` / `RUNTIME`
    overrides so callers (and tests) keep the documented "user-provided
    vars always win" behaviour without re-implementing the merge.

    `active_variants` is the per-app variant index for the round this
    folder represents. Apps absent from the mapping (or with an out-of-
    range index) fall back to variant 0. The resolved variant payload
    for every app in `include` is baked into the inventory as an
    `applications.<app>` override, so the deploy stage no longer needs
    a runtime variant selector — the inventory itself is variant-resolved.

    `network_mode` is the node `NETWORK_MODE` provisioning writes; empty
    leaves it to the derivation from the deployed providers.
