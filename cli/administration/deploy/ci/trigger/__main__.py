"""Trigger the manual CI run (entry-manual-steer.yml) for the current branch.

entry-manual-steer.yml reads the "__ALL__" whitelist sentinel as "force a full
deploy across all roles".

A retrigger differs from its source run in the selection and in nothing else:
every other dispatch input is carried over (:func:`runs.carried_inputs`, read
off the workflow itself), and the priority line names the exact selections that
failed -- role, variant, deploy mode, network mode and distro -- rather than the
roles they belong to. The filesystem is left to the rotation
(:mod:`cli.administration.deploy.ci.selections` says why). ``--chunk-gate`` is
the one deliberate exception: it overrides the carried value so a retrigger can
keep deploying past a failed chunk.
