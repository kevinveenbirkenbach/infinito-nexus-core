"""Shared helpers for the CI deploy-run status/trigger commands.

Reads GitHub Actions runs via the ``gh`` CLI and maps the per-app
compose ("docker") and swarm deploy jobs to pass/fail/abort states.
A mode job that ran but did not finish successfully (cancelled, timed out,
still running) counts as a failure; a mode the role has no job for is N/A
and never fails the aggregated ``total`` column.

Deploy jobs are matched by the compose/swarm/host glyph (from the symbol
glossary, the single source of truth) their test-deploy-{compose,swarm,host}.yml
matrix titles them with -- NOT the words "Compose"/"Swarm"/"Host", which no
real job carries (matching those made ``--failed swarm`` silently find
nothing). What follows the glyph is the role's display name
(``utils.roles.display``), decoded back to the role id; a bare role id from a
run that predates the display names decodes just as well. The orchestrator
prepends a "caller / " prefix and the shard suffix (e.g. " 0,1") rides along
in the display name; both are tolerated.
