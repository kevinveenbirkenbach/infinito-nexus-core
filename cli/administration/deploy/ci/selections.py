"""Turn a run's deploy jobs back into selection tokens.

A deploy job title carries the whole row it deployed -- role, variant, mode,
network mode, distro, filesystem -- and :mod:`utils.github.variant.selection`
is the grammar that writes it back down.

The filesystem is the one axis a token built here leaves out. The title states
the kind the matrix *assigned*, which a deploy is allowed to fall back from
when the host cannot serve it, so the title does not prove what the job ran on.
Writing it into a token would also state it as named by a human, which makes it
binding (:func:`utils.github.variant.axes.assign`): a retrigger would then fail
on the very condition the fallback exists to absorb. The retrigger lets the
rotation assign it again and reports what it got. Reading the tokens out of a finished run is what lets a
retrigger replay exactly what failed and start the regular line where that run
stopped, instead of aggregating to role ids and guessing the rest.
