"""
Integration test: ensure every TOP-LEVEL ALL-CAPS variable is defined only once project-wide.

Scope (by design):
- group_vars/**/*.yml
- roles/*/vars/*.yml
- roles/*/defaults/*.yml
- roles/*/defauls/*.yml   # included on purpose in case of folder typos

A variable is considered a “constant” if its KEY (at the top level of a YAML document)
matches: ^[A-Z0-9_]+$

Only TOP-LEVEL keys are checked for uniqueness. Nested keys are ignored to allow
namespacing like DICTIONARYA.ENTRY and DICTIONARYB.ENTRY without conflicts.
