"""Process-level cached helpers for tests that scan the project tree.

Many integration/lint tests walk the whole repo and read every matching file.
Doing that N times per pytest run is wasteful — the tree doesn't change during
a run. These helpers walk the tree once per process and memoise both the path
list and file contents, so every test after the first one pays near-zero cost.

Usage:

    from tests.utils.fs import iter_project_files, read_text

    for path in iter_project_files(extensions=(".yml", ".yml.j2"), exclude_tests=True):
        content = read_text(path)
        ...

`PROJECT_ROOT` is the repo root derived from this file's location.
