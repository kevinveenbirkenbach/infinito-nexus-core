"""Render CI deploy-job display names from their workflow source of truth.

Single point of truth for test fixtures so they cannot drift back to job
names GitHub never emits -- the bug that silently made ``--failed swarm`` a
no-op was masked by fixtures hand-typed as ``🐳 Compose web-app-x``, which no
real job is ever called.

Since the deploy modes collapsed into one workflow, a job's mode is no longer
in the workflow file name but in the row's own label, so the glyph prefix is
built here the same way ``utils.github.variant.axes`` builds it.
