"""Lint: every ``matrix.<key>`` the deploy workflow reads must be a key the
matrix builder emits.

The deploy job's steps are wired to the matrix entry by name. GitHub resolves
an unknown ``matrix.<key>`` to the empty string rather than failing, so a typo
or a key the builder stopped emitting reaches the runner as an empty
environment variable and the job deploys something other than the row it was
given -- silently, in every case. An empty ``INFINITO_DISTROS`` does not abort:
``scripts/tests/deploy/distros.sh`` sources the env layer before its own
``:?`` guard, and ``scripts/meta/env/load.sh`` replaces an empty caller value
with the generated one, so the row sweeps all five distros instead of the one
it was assigned. An empty ``matrix.disable`` leaves a provider in the closure.

The keys are read from :func:`utils.github.variant.axes.assign` itself, minus
the ones :data:`cli.meta.ci.matrix.DROPPED` withholds from the JSON, so this
compares the workflow against the builder rather than against a second list.
