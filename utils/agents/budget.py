"""Does the agents bundle fit its resource budget.

The bundle fits when ``agents.max_running`` times the largest runtime memory
reservation, plus the infrastructure the bundle always runs, stays within the
repository's per-variant budget. Only ``max_running`` agents run at once, so
the cap is bounded by the largest single runtime, not the sum of all declared
runtimes. This is the deterministic fit check; the reservations and the cap
come from the inventory and meta/services.yml.
