"""The instance API's registration and lease rules, the stack-free part.

A throwaway instance on a developer machine registers its name together with a
public key. A later registration of the same name with a different key is
refused; the same key takes over, so a restarted instance keeps its name but a
stranger cannot steal it. Provisioned accounts are held on a lease the reaper
deprovisions once it expires. The deployed API persists this; the rules live
here and are unit-tested.
