"""Assign the deploy axes to CI matrix rows.

Every row of the CI matrix is one ``role#variant`` selection. Four axes are
decided here, all as a deterministic rotation over the row's position in the
*global* discovery order and the sweep number -- never at random, so a red job
can be reproduced by re-running the same sweep, and so consecutive sweeps
cover the combinations instead of sampling them:

* **mode** -- which of ``compose``/``swarm``/``host`` the row deploys in,
  drawn from the modes the role actually offers. In practice that is at most
  two: swarm requires the role to ship its own stack, host requires it not to.
  ``(position + sweep) % len(offered)`` therefore flips a row between its two
  modes on consecutive sweeps.

* **network** -- which node network mode (``clearnet``, ``tor``, ``multi``)
  the row deploys in, drawn from the modes its role can be served in. Driven
  by ``sweep // 2`` so it does NOT flip in lockstep with the mode; a row walks
  every mode/network combination instead of a diagonal through them.

* **distro** -- which declared distribution the row deploys on. Per row rather
  than per run, so one sweep proves every distribution instead of proving one
  and claiming nothing about the other four, and a red row still names the
  exact distribution it died on.

* **filesystem** -- which kind the row's docker data root runs on. The two
  read the row's position like an odometer: the distro is the low digit and
  the filesystem the high one, so consecutive rows walk every pairing rather
  than a diagonal through it. Turning both on the position directly would
  cover only ``n`` of the ``n x m`` pairs whenever the two pools happen to be
  the same length, and no sweep would unlock it, because the sweep shifts both
  by the same amount.

A row's position is its index in the uncapped discovery order, not its index
inside a chunk, so slicing the list into chunks never changes what a row is
assigned. A priority row, which deploys several mode/network combinations at
once, walks the distro and filesystem rotations across those combinations
rather than repeating one pair.
