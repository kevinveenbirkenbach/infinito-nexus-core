"""Which matrix entry replays its role's README instructions.

The replay used to be a job of its own, picking one random role per run. It
rides on a deploy row instead: the role's smallest variant among the rows this
sweep actually deploys, marked with ``instructions`` (the mode the replay runs
in) and a 📖 in the job title. :mod:`utils.roles.guide` decides which variant
that is; this module is what turns the decision into matrix entries.

    variant number and the ⭐ of a priority row, with no space between the two:

    The row has to run in the guide's own mode. The replay is a second deploy

    bring a compose stack up beside a swarm one. Only rows in that mode count
