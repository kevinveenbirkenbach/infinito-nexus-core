Infinito.Nexus RBAC & Profile Mapping
=====================================

Shared helpers for the sign-in overrides of auth_oauth_https and
auth_ldap_profile:

* resolves the declared roles of the deployment (ODOO_RBAC_ROLES) into Odoo
  groups and refuses a sign-in that holds none of them, the platform
  administrator (ODOO_RBAC_PROTECTED_LOGIN) excepted;
* replaces the managed groups of a user with the groups its roles grant;
* validates profile values (name, email, phone, language, time zone) against
  what the database accepts before they are written.
