# OpenProject

## Description

Transform your project management with [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/), a vibrant and collaborative tool that brings clarity and energy to your planning, tracking, and team communication. Experience streamlined workflows and an innovative platform that propels your projects forward.

## Overview

Designed for simplicity, this role automates everything needed to run OpenProject in a containerized environment. It configures essential services such as the application itself, a PostgreSQL database, reverse proxy, and optional LDAP integration for identity management.

## Purpose

The purpose of this role is to reduce the complexity of setting up OpenProject with modern production-ready defaults. By combining Docker Compose and Ansible automation, it enables a hands-off setup for both small teams and larger internal infrastructures.

## Features

- **Work Package Management:**
  Create, assign, track, and prioritize tasks and issues with customizable workflows that keep your project organized and on schedule.

- **Gantt Charts & Timelines:**
  Visualize project schedules and dependencies using intuitive Gantt charts and timeline views, enabling effective planning and resource allocation.

- **Agile Boards & Scrum/Kanban Integration:**
  Manage agile projects using Scrum or Kanban boards, track progress through sprints, and maintain a clear overview of work in progress.

- **Time Tracking & Cost Management:**
  Record time spent on tasks to monitor productivity and generate detailed cost reports to manage budgets effectively.

- **Collaboration & Document Management:**
  Facilitate team collaboration with built-in discussion forums, document sharing, and version control, ensuring all project documentation remains up to date.

- **Robust Reporting & Dashboards:**
  Gain insights through comprehensive reporting features and customizable dashboards that help monitor project performance and key metrics.

- **Custom Plugins & Extensibility:**
  Extend functionality with a wide variety of plugins and integrations, or create your own to tailor OpenProject to your unique workflow.

- **Role-Based Access Control & Security:**
  Manage user permissions precisely to ensure that sensitive information and critical functions remain secure.

- **Restricted sign-in:** Only members of the `administrator` and `user` role groups pass the oauth2-proxy gate (`sso.oauth2.allowed_groups`) and the LDAP `filter_string` of the auth source.

- **Administrator reconcile:** [reconcile_admins.rb](./files/ruby/reconcile_admins.rb) grants OpenProject administrator rights to the members of the `administrator` role group, provisions those that have no account yet from LDAP, and revokes the rights from every other account except the platform administrator and the GitLab bot. It runs as a container hook of [sys-ctl-mtn-rbac-sync](../sys-ctl-mtn-rbac-sync/) at every deploy and on its timer, so a group change in Keycloak or LDAP reaches `User.admin` within one timer interval.

## Addons

OpenProject's cross-role integrations are declared in `meta/addons/`, one file per addon:

| Addon | Mechanism | Default state | Bridges |
|-------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `gitlab_integration` | `module` | enabled whenever the `gitlab` service is present (`web-app-gitlab` co-deployed) | `gitlab` → `web-app-gitlab` |
| `storages` | `module` | enabled whenever the `nextcloud` service is present (`web-app-nextcloud` co-deployed) | `nextcloud` → `web-app-nextcloud` |
| `openid_connect` | `module` | disabled | `sso` → `web-app-keycloak` |

All three modules ship with the OpenProject image, and `tasks/05_addons.yml` runs the hook of every addon whose gate resolves true.

`gitlab_integration` is provisioned here: [files/ruby/addons/gitlab/ensure_gitlab_webhook.rb](./files/ruby/addons/gitlab/ensure_gitlab_webhook.rb) creates the bot account declared in [meta/users.yml](./meta/users.yml), issues its API token, and writes `gitlab_user_id` plus the webhook secret into the plugin setting. The token is published to the token store; the webhook on the partner GitLab is not created by this role and the hook prints the URL to register it against.

`storages` is provisioned entirely from the other side: [web-app-nextcloud](../web-app-nextcloud/) container-execs into this role's web container and creates the `Storages::NextcloudStorage`, its OAuth application and the matching Nextcloud client. The deploy order places this role before `web-app-nextcloud`, so nothing of that exists while this role runs and its hook stays empty.

`openid_connect` is gated behind OpenProject's Enterprise tier, so this deployment reaches Keycloak through the oauth2-proxy front door declared by the `sso` service instead, and the addon stays off.

Each addon's spec lives under `files/playwright/addons/`.

## Developer Notes

To inspect and modify live settings inside the container, open a shell and use the Rails console for full LDAP and SMTP configuration.

## Major Upgrades

A compose deploy reads `schema_migrations` of an existing database before the pinned image starts. The newest aggregated migration `1000NNN` marks a schema migrated by major NNN + 1; without one, `20241015081341` marks 15 and anything older counts as 14. For every major between that stage and the pinned `services.web.version`, the deploy stops the old app containers, runs the seeder of `openproject/openproject:<major>` and works off the queued GoodJob jobs with [drain_jobs.rb](./files/ruby/drain_jobs.rb), then starts the pinned major. A database migrated by a newer major than the pinned one stops the deploy. Swarm deploys skip the stepping, so the pinned seeder reports an incompatible schema itself.

## Persona contract opt-outs

The `administrator` persona is **not** blocked: [tasks/04_admin.yml](./tasks/04_admin.yml) seeds a native OpenProject account whose password is the Keycloak administrator secret, so the journey runs in every variant. The `biber` persona is blocked in every variant: biber holds no OpenProject role, so the oauth2-proxy gate and the LDAP `filter_string` refuse it. [test-rbac-gate.js](./files/playwright/test-rbac-gate.js) asserts that refusal, then adds biber to the `user` role group and drives the sign-in through the trusted-header bridge. Both flags are declared explicitly in [templates/playwright.env.j2](./templates/playwright.env.j2).
