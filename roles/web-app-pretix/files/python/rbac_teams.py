"""Converge the RBAC teams of every Pretix organizer and their pretix-oidc assignment rules.

A team needs an organizer, so a deployment without one gets the deployment
organizer first.

``shell_scoped`` feeds this to IPython, which ends an indented block at the
first blank or dedented line, so the whole body lives in one blank-line-free
function and the last statement is a top-level print of a marker the task
matches on.

Environment:
    RBAC_CLAIM:     ID token claim the assignment rules read.
    RBAC_TEAMS:     JSON list of {name, group, all_event_permissions,
                    limit_event_permissions, all_organizer_permissions}.
    ORGANIZER_NAME: name of the organizer created when none exists.
    ORGANIZER_SLUG: slug of the organizer created when none exists.

Output:
    PRETIX_RESULT=CHANGED or PRETIX_RESULT=UNCHANGED on its own line.
