# Joomla

## Description

[Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) is a free and open-source content management system that lets users build and run websites, intranets, and online applications without writing code. It exposes a component, module, and plugin architecture that authors and developers extend with custom content types, layouts, and integrations.

## Overview

This role deploys Joomla on Docker Compose. It builds a custom Joomla image that bakes in Composer for runtime extension builds, runs the Joomla CLI installer with the role's database, and installs the in-role `plg_system_keycloak` plugin so the site speaks OIDC against Keycloak with RBAC group mapping. A matrix-deploy variant flips the role to LDAP via Joomla's core LDAP authentication plugin instead.

For the OIDC plugin source and its environment contract see [README.md](./files/joomla-oidc-plugin/README.md).

## Addons

Role-level extensions are declared in `meta/addons/`
(unified addon contract, requirement 026):

| Addon | Mechanism | Default state | Bridges |
|-------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `plg_system_keycloak` | `plugin` | enabled whenever the `sso` service is present (`web-app-keycloak` co-deployed) | `sso` → `web-app-keycloak` |

`plg_system_keycloak` is built imperatively inside the Joomla container and speaks OIDC against Keycloak.
Its enablement derives directly from the `sso` service flag, and its OIDC runtime contract (issuer, client id/secret, redirect/end-session URLs, fallback toggle, and RBAC group paths) lives under the addon's `config:` block, which [`templates/env.j2`](./templates/env.j2) renders into the `JOOMLA_OIDC_*` plugin environment.

## Features

- **Containerized deployment:** Run Joomla through Docker Compose with the role-specific custom image.
- **Native OIDC SSO:** Authenticate users against Keycloak via the in-role `plg_system_keycloak` plugin, with `?fallback=local` as an env-toggleable emergency hatch.
- **RBAC group mapping:** Map the Keycloak groups of the `administrator`, `manager`, `publisher`, `editor`, `author` and `registered` roles onto Joomla's built-in `Super Users`, `Manager`, `Publisher`, `Editor`, `Author` and `Registered` user groups on every login.
- **Open access:** Let every realm user sign in; a user without a mapped role group lands in the com_users "New User Registration Group" (`Registered`).
- **Profile sync:** Overwrite name, email, frontend language (from the `locale` claim, resolved to an installed site language) and time zone (from the `zoneinfo` claim) on every login, so Keycloak stays the source of truth.
- **Contact sync:** Enable the core `plg_user_profile` and overwrite its phone, street, city, region, postal code, country and website fields from the `phone_number`, `address` and `website` claims on every login; the plugin requests the `phone` and `address` scopes, and the profile form hides the profile fields Keycloak does not feed.
- **Read-only IdP fields:** Render every field Keycloak overwrites read-only in the com_users profile form of an SSO account, and keep the stored values when a profile save carries others.
- **SSO logout:** Route a com_users Log out request through Keycloak's end-session endpoint, so signing out of Joomla also ends the Keycloak session; with the `logout` service on, its injected script sends the button to the universal logout first.
- **LDAP variant:** Configure and enable Joomla's core `plg_authentication_ldap` against `svc-db-openldap` whenever the `ldap` service is enabled (variant 1), binding with the directory administrator, searching users by their login attribute and reading full name and email from the directory; new directory users are created in `Registered`.
- **External database:** Persist Joomla content in the project's central RDBMS through the standard role-meta wiring.
- **NGINX reverse proxy:** Front the Joomla container with the project's `sys-stk-front-proxy` for TLS termination and per-domain routing.

## Developer Notes

See [README.md](./files/joomla-oidc-plugin/README.md) for the OIDC plugin's manifest, services provider, runtime environment, and route map.

## End-to-end tests

The Playwright spec at [`playwright.spec.js`](./files/playwright/playwright.spec.js) covers:

- the administrator's Keycloak SSO handshake and the local form-login emergency hatch (`?fallback=local`);
- `biber` in each of the `administrator`, `manager`, `publisher`, `editor`, `author` and `registered` groups landing in the matching Joomla group, the bootstrap administrator keeping `Super Users` without the `administrator` group, and `biber` without a role group landing in `Registered`, read from Users: Manage ([`test-rbac-groups.js`](./files/playwright/test-rbac-groups.js));
- the `locale`, `zoneinfo`, phone, address and website Keycloak attributes of `biber` arriving as Joomla language, time zone and `plg_user_profile` fields, every synced field read-only, and a save with a tampered name keeping the Keycloak name ([`test-profile-sync.js`](./files/playwright/test-profile-sync.js));
- the com_users Log out button ending the Keycloak session, through the issuer's end-session endpoint when `logout` is off and through the universal logout otherwise ([`test-sso-logout.js`](./files/playwright/test-sso-logout.js));
- the administrator and `biber` signing in through the core LDAP plugin in the LDAP variant ([`test-ldap-login.js`](./files/playwright/test-ldap-login.js)), and `plg_authentication_ldap` staying disabled in Extensions: Plugins while `ldap` is off ([`test-ldap-disabled.js`](./files/playwright/test-ldap-disabled.js)).

SSO scenarios are gated on `sso` and LDAP scenarios on `ldap`, so a deploy without the service reports them as `skipped`, never `failed`.

## Persona contract opt-outs

The shared `biber` and `administrator` persona journeys are opted out via `PERSONA_BIBER_BLOCKED` / `PERSONA_ADMINISTRATOR_BLOCKED` in `templates/playwright.env.j2`.
The site front page renders no logout control: Joomla's site template places no login module, and the only rendered Log out button sits on the com_users login view, so the persona's mandatory in-app logout click on the front page has no target and navigating a logout URL directly is forbidden by the contract.
The OIDC handshake itself, the Keycloak logout from the com_users Log out button, the LDAP variant and the `/administrator?fallback=local` hatch are covered by `files/playwright/test-oidc-login.js`, `test-sso-logout.js`, `test-ldap-login.js` and `test-oidc-fallback.js`.
