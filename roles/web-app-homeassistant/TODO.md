# TODO

- Product name: the sidebar title, the `alt` text of the sign-in logo, the web app manifest (`name`, icons) and the launch screen logo still show Home Assistant; the frontend offers no setting for them, and the theme and the sign-in stylesheet do not reach them.
- Sign-in stylesheet: `templates/style.css.j2` repeats the `--wa-color-*` assignments Home Assistant derives on `html`, because the sign-in page takes no theme. Compare the list with the frontend when the image version moves.
- The directory sign-in searches the users OU anonymously before it binds, because the hub holds no directory service account. Options: a read-only service bind DN in `svc-db-openldap` passed as an argument, if anonymous reads are ever closed.
- The user-tier scenario in `files/playwright/test-ldap-login.js` grants biber the `user` role group through Keycloak and skips in a deployment without `web-app-keycloak`. Options: a directory write helper in the shared Playwright library.
